# git-pkgs

A git subcommand for tracking package dependencies across git history. Analyzes your repository to show when dependencies were added, modified, or removed, who made those changes, and why. This is a rewrite of the [original Ruby version](https://github.com/andrew/git-pkgs).

## Why this exists

Your lockfile shows what dependencies you have, but it doesn't show how you got here, and `git log Gemfile.lock` is useless noise. git-pkgs indexes your dependency history into a queryable database so you can ask questions like: when did we add this? who added it? what changed between these two releases? has anyone touched this in the last year?

For best results, commit your lockfiles. Manifests show version ranges but lockfiles show what actually got installed, including transitive dependencies.

It works across many ecosystems (Gemfile, package.json, Dockerfile, GitHub Actions workflows) giving you one unified history instead of separate tools per ecosystem. The database lives in your `.git` directory where you can use it in CI to catch dependency changes in pull requests.

The core commands (`list`, `history`, `blame`, `diff`, `stale`, etc.) work entirely from your git history with no network access. Additional commands fetch external data: `vulns` checks [OSV](https://osv.dev) for known CVEs, `outdated`, `freshness`, `licenses`, and `funding` query [ecosyste.ms](https://packages.ecosyste.ms/) for registry metadata, `deprecated` checks registries for deprecation metadata, and `changelog` fetches upstream changelogs so you can see what changed between versions.

## Installation

```bash
brew install git-pkgs
```

Or download a binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/git-pkgs/git-pkgs/releases).

Or build from source:

```bash
go install github.com/git-pkgs/git-pkgs@latest
```

## Quick start

```bash
cd your-repo
git pkgs init           # analyze history (one-time)
git pkgs list           # show current dependencies
git pkgs stats          # see overview
git pkgs blame          # who added each dependency
git pkgs history        # all dependency changes over time
git pkgs history rails  # track a specific package
git pkgs why rails      # why was this added?
git pkgs diff                 # HEAD vs working tree
git pkgs diff --from=HEAD~10  # what changed recently?
git pkgs diff main..feature   # compare branches
git pkgs vulns          # scan for known CVEs
git pkgs vulns blame    # who introduced each vulnerability
git pkgs outdated       # find packages with newer versions
git pkgs freshness      # release-age freshness metrics
git pkgs deprecated     # find deprecated installed versions
git pkgs funding        # show packages with funding links
git pkgs changelog lodash -e npm --from 4.17.20 --to 4.17.21  # view changelog
git pkgs update         # update all dependencies
git pkgs add lodash     # add a package
git pkgs why pkg:npm/lodash  # use a PURL instead of -e flag
```

## Commands

### Initialize the database

```bash
git pkgs init
```

Walks through git history and builds a SQLite database of dependency changes, stored in `.git/pkgs.sqlite3`.

Options:
- `--branch=NAME` - analyze a specific branch (default: default branch)
- `--since=SHA` - start analysis from a specific commit
- `--force` - rebuild the database from scratch
- `--no-hooks` - skip installing git hooks (hooks are installed by default)

### Database info

```bash
git pkgs info
```

Shows database size and row counts:

### Explain why a dependency exists

```bash
git pkgs why rails
git pkgs why pkg:gem/rails
```

This shows the commit that added the dependency along with the author and message.

### Dependency tree

```bash
git pkgs tree
git pkgs tree --ecosystem=rubygems
```

This shows dependencies grouped by type (runtime, development, etc).

### Find stale dependencies

```bash
git pkgs stale                  # list deps by how long since last touched
git pkgs stale --days=365       # only show deps untouched for a year
git pkgs stale --ecosystem=npm  # filter by ecosystem
```

Shows dependencies sorted by how long since they were last changed in your repo. Useful for finding packages that may have been forgotten or need review.

### Check freshness metrics

```bash
git pkgs freshness                  # average days behind latest releases
git pkgs freshness --limit=20       # show more lagging dependencies
git pkgs freshness --ecosystem=npm  # filter by ecosystem
```

Compares installed versions with registry release dates to report average days behind latest and the dependencies with the largest release-date lag.

### Find outdated dependencies

```bash
git pkgs outdated               # show packages with newer versions available
git pkgs outdated --major       # only major version updates
git pkgs outdated --minor       # minor and major updates (skip patch)
git pkgs outdated --at v2.0     # what was outdated when we released v2.0?
git pkgs outdated --at 2024-03-01  # what was outdated on this date?
```

Checks package registries (via [ecosyste.ms](https://packages.ecosyste.ms/)) to find dependencies with newer versions available. Major updates are shown in red, minor in yellow, patch in cyan.

The `--at` flag enables time travel: pass a date (YYYY-MM-DD) or any git ref (tag, branch, commit SHA) to see what was outdated at that point in time. When given a git ref, it uses the commit's date.

### Find deprecated dependencies

```bash
git pkgs deprecated               # show deprecated installed versions
git pkgs deprecated --ecosystem=npm
git pkgs deprecated --format=json
```

Checks the exact installed dependency versions against registries and reports versions marked as deprecated, including registry-provided messages when available.

### Show funding info

```bash
git pkgs funding                # show dependencies with funding links
git pkgs funding --missing      # show dependencies without funding links
git pkgs funding --ecosystem=npm
git pkgs funding --format=json
```

Checks ecosyste.ms package metadata for funding links so you can see which dependencies publish sponsorship information and which ones do not.

### View changelogs

```bash
git pkgs changelog lodash -e npm --from 4.17.20 --to 4.17.21
git pkgs changelog pkg:cargo/serde --from 1.0.0 --to 1.0.200
git pkgs changelog express -e npm   # all entries up to latest
```

Fetches the upstream changelog for a package and shows entries between two versions. Uses [ecosyste.ms](https://packages.ecosyste.ms/) to find the repository and changelog file, then parses it with [git-pkgs/changelog](https://github.com/git-pkgs/changelog). Supports GitHub and GitLab repositories.

### Manage dependencies

git-pkgs can run package manager commands for you, detecting the right tool from your lockfiles:

```bash
git pkgs install              # install from lockfile
git pkgs install --frozen     # CI mode (fail if lockfile would change)
git pkgs add lodash           # add a package
git pkgs add rails --dev      # add as dev dependency
git pkgs add lodash 4.17.21   # add specific version
git pkgs add pkg:npm/lodash@4.17.21  # same thing, using a PURL
git pkgs remove lodash        # remove a package
git pkgs remove pkg:npm/lodash       # remove using a PURL
git pkgs update               # update all dependencies
git pkgs update lodash        # update specific package
git pkgs update pkg:npm/lodash       # update using a PURL
git pkgs resolve              # print dependency graph
```

The `resolve` command runs the package manager's dependency graph command, parses the output into a normalized JSON structure with [PURLs](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec), and prints the result. Use `--raw` to get the unparsed manager output instead.

Supports 35 package managers including npm, pnpm, yarn, bun, deno, bundler, gem, cargo, go, pip, uv, poetry, conda, composer, mix, rebar3, pub, cocoapods, swift, nuget, maven, gradle, sbt, cabal, stack, opam, luarocks, nimble, shards, cpanm, lein, vcpkg, conan, helm, and brew. The package manager is detected from lockfiles in the current directory.

Use `-m` to override detection, `-x` to pass extra arguments to the underlying tool:

```bash
git pkgs install -m pnpm                    # force pnpm
git pkgs install -x --legacy-peer-deps      # pass extra flags
git pkgs add lodash -x --save-exact         # npm --save-exact
```

### Browse package source

Open the source code of an installed package in your editor:

```bash
git pkgs browse lodash           # open in $EDITOR
git pkgs browse lodash --path    # just print the path
git pkgs browse lodash --open    # open in file browser
git pkgs browse serde -m cargo   # specify manager
git pkgs browse pkg:npm/lodash   # use a PURL
```

Use `--path` for scripting:

```bash
cat $(git pkgs browse lodash --path)/package.json
```

Returns exit code 2 if the package manager doesn't support path lookup.

### Check licenses

```bash
git pkgs licenses               # show license for each dependency
git pkgs licenses --permissive  # flag copyleft licenses
git pkgs licenses --allow=MIT,Apache-2.0  # explicit allow list
git pkgs licenses --group       # group output by license
```

Fetches license information from package registries. Exits with code 1 if violations are found, making it suitable for CI.

### Vulnerability scanning

Scan dependencies for known CVEs using the [OSV database](https://osv.dev). Because git-pkgs tracks the full history of every dependency change, it provides context that static scanners can't: who introduced a vulnerability, when it was fixed, and how long you were exposed.

```bash
git pkgs vulns                  # scan current dependencies
git pkgs vulns v1.0.0           # scan at a tag, branch, or commit
git pkgs vulns -s high          # only critical and high severity
git pkgs vulns -e npm           # filter by ecosystem
git pkgs vulns -f sarif         # output for GitHub code scanning
```

Subcommands for historical analysis:

```bash
git pkgs vulns blame            # who introduced each vulnerability
git pkgs vulns blame --all-time # include fixed vulnerabilities
git pkgs vulns praise           # who fixed vulnerabilities
git pkgs vulns praise --summary # author leaderboard
git pkgs vulns exposure         # remediation metrics (CRA compliance)
git pkgs vulns diff main feature # compare vulnerability state between refs
git pkgs vulns log              # commits that introduced or fixed vulns
git pkgs vulns history lodash   # vulnerability timeline for a package
git pkgs vulns history pkg:npm/lodash  # same thing, using a PURL
git pkgs vulns show CVE-2024-1234  # details about a specific CVE
```

Output formats: `text` (default), `json`, and `sarif`. SARIF integrates with GitHub Advanced Security:

```yaml
- run: git pkgs vulns -f sarif > results.sarif
- uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
  with:
    sarif_file: results.sarif
```

Vulnerability data is cached locally and refreshed automatically when stale (>24h). Use `git pkgs vulns sync --refresh` to force an update.

### Integrity verification

Show SHA256 hashes from lockfiles. Modern lockfiles include checksums that verify package contents haven't been tampered with.

```bash
git pkgs integrity              # show hashes for current dependencies
git pkgs integrity --drift      # detect same version with different hashes
git pkgs integrity -f json      # JSON output
```

The `--drift` flag scans your history for packages where the same version has different integrity hashes, which could indicate a supply chain issue.

### SBOM export

Export dependencies as a Software Bill of Materials in CycloneDX or SPDX format:

```bash
git pkgs sbom                      # CycloneDX JSON (default)
git pkgs sbom --type spdx          # SPDX JSON
git pkgs sbom -f xml               # XML instead of JSON
git pkgs sbom --name my-project    # custom project name
```

Includes package URLs (purls), versions, and licenses (fetched from registries). Use `--skip-enrichment` to omit license lookups.

### Diff between commits or working tree

```bash
git pkgs diff                             # HEAD vs working tree
git pkgs diff --from=abc123 --to=def456   # between two commits
git pkgs diff --from=HEAD~10              # HEAD~10 vs working tree
git pkgs diff main..feature               # compare branches
git pkgs diff main..feature --stat        # aggregate counts only
git pkgs diff --type=development          # only dev dependency changes
git pkgs diff --ecosystem=npm             # filter by ecosystem
```

With no arguments, compares HEAD against the working tree (like `git diff`). Shows added, removed, and modified packages with version info. Use `--stat` or `--summary` for one-line aggregate counts.

### Diff between files

Compare dependencies between two manifest files directly, without a git repository or database:

```bash
git pkgs diff-file Gemfile.lock.old Gemfile.lock
git pkgs diff-file /path/to/project-a/package.json /path/to/project-b/package.json
git pkgs diff-file before.lock after.lock --filename=Gemfile.lock  # override type detection
git pkgs diff-file old.lock new.lock -f json  # JSON output
```

Useful for comparing dependencies across different projects, archived source code without git history, or repositories using other version control systems.

### Show changes in a commit

```bash
git pkgs show              # show dependency changes in HEAD
git pkgs show abc123       # specific commit
git pkgs show HEAD~5       # relative ref
```

Like `git show` but for dependencies. Shows what was added, modified, or removed in a single commit.

### Find where a package is declared

```bash
git pkgs where rails           # find in manifest files
git pkgs where pkg:gem/rails   # find using a PURL
git pkgs where lodash -C 2     # show 2 lines of context
git pkgs where express --ecosystem=npm
```

Shows which manifest files declare a package and the exact line:

```
Gemfile:5:gem "rails", "~> 7.0"
Gemfile.lock:142:    rails (7.0.8)
```

Like `grep` but scoped to manifest files that git-pkgs knows about.

### Package URLs

Show registry URLs for a package (registry page, download, documentation, PURL):

```bash
git pkgs urls pkg:cargo/serde@1.0.0           # from a PURL
git pkgs urls lodash --ecosystem npm           # from the database
git pkgs urls pkg:npm/express@4.19.0 -f json   # JSON output
```

Example output:
```
docs       https://docs.rs/serde/1.0.0
download   https://static.crates.io/crates/serde/serde-1.0.0.crate
purl       pkg:cargo/serde@1.0.0
registry   https://crates.io/crates/serde/1.0.0
```

When given a PURL, no database is needed. When given a plain package name, the database is searched for a matching dependency and the ecosystem is inferred. Use `--ecosystem` to disambiguate when a name appears in multiple ecosystems.

Most commands that take a package name also accept PURLs. A PURL like `pkg:npm/lodash@4.17.21` replaces both the package name and `--ecosystem` flag. For example, `git pkgs why pkg:npm/lodash` is equivalent to `git pkgs why lodash -e npm`. Commands that accept PURLs: `why`, `history`, `where`, `browse`, `add`, `remove`, `update`, `urls`, and `vulns history`.

### Search dependencies

```bash
git pkgs search rails            # find dependencies matching a pattern
git pkgs search react --ecosystem=npm
git pkgs search "^post" --direct # only direct dependencies, not lockfile
```

Searches the database for dependencies whose names match the given pattern. Shows the matching name, version requirement, ecosystem, and when the dependency was first seen and last changed.

### List commits with dependency changes

```bash
git pkgs log                  # recent commits with dependency changes
git pkgs log --author=alice   # filter by author
git pkgs log --exclude-bots   # hide bot-authored commits
git pkgs log -n 50            # show more commits
```

Like `git log` but only shows commits that changed dependencies, with the changes listed under each commit.

### Bisect dependency changes

Find when a dependency-related change was introduced using binary search, similar to `git bisect` but only considering commits that changed dependencies:

```bash
git pkgs bisect start
git pkgs bisect bad HEAD                    # current version has the problem
git pkgs bisect good v1.0.0                 # this version was fine
# git-pkgs checks out a commit with dependency changes
git pkgs bisect good                        # or bad, depending on your test
# repeat until found
git pkgs bisect reset                       # end session
```

Automate with a script:

```bash
git pkgs bisect start HEAD v1.0.0
git pkgs bisect run sh -c 'capslock | grep -q NETWORK && exit 1 || exit 0'
```

This finds when dependencies gained NETWORK capabilities. Exit codes: 0 = good, 1-124 = bad, 125 = skip.

Find when a GPL license was introduced:

```bash
git pkgs bisect start HEAD v1.0.0
git pkgs bisect run sh -c 'git pkgs licenses --allow=MIT,Apache-2.0 >/dev/null 2>&1'
```

Narrow the search with filters:

```bash
git pkgs bisect start --ecosystem=npm HEAD v1.0.0      # only npm changes
git pkgs bisect start --package=lodash HEAD v1.0.0     # only lodash changes
git pkgs bisect start --manifest=package.json HEAD v1.0.0
```

See `docs/bisect.md` for detailed examples and use cases.

### Keep database updated

After the initial analysis, the database updates automatically via git hooks installed during init. You can also update manually:

```bash
git pkgs reindex
```

To manage hooks separately:

```bash
git pkgs hooks              # show hook status
git pkgs hooks --install    # install hooks
git pkgs hooks --uninstall  # remove hooks
```

### Upgrading

After updating git-pkgs, you may need to rebuild the database if the schema has changed:

```bash
git pkgs upgrade
```

This is detected automatically and you'll see a message if an upgrade is needed.

### Show database schema

```bash
git pkgs schema                   # human-readable table format
git pkgs schema --format=sql      # CREATE TABLE statements
git pkgs schema --format=json     # JSON structure
git pkgs schema --format=markdown # markdown tables
```

### GitHub Actions

Reusable actions for CI are available at [git-pkgs/actions](https://github.com/git-pkgs/actions):

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    with:
      fetch-depth: 0

  - uses: git-pkgs/actions/setup@v1
  - uses: git-pkgs/actions/diff@v1
  - uses: git-pkgs/actions/vulns@v1
    with:
      severity: "high"
  - uses: git-pkgs/actions/licenses@v1
    with:
      deny: "GPL-3.0-only,AGPL-3.0-only"
```

See the [CI/CD docs](https://git-pkgs.dev/docs/ci-cd/) for more examples.

### Diff driver

Install a git textconv driver that shows semantic dependency changes instead of raw lockfile diffs:

```bash
git pkgs diff-driver --install
```

Now `git diff` on lockfiles shows a sorted dependency list instead of raw lockfile changes:

```diff
diff --git a/Gemfile.lock b/Gemfile.lock
--- a/Gemfile.lock
+++ b/Gemfile.lock
@@ -1,3 +1,3 @@
+kamal 1.0.0 (runtime)
-puma 5.0.0 (runtime)
+puma 6.0.0 (runtime)
 rails 7.0.0 (runtime)
-sidekiq 6.0.0 (runtime)
```

Use `git diff --no-textconv` to see the raw lockfile diff. To remove: `git pkgs diff-driver --uninstall`

### Shell completions

Enable tab completion for commands:

```bash
# Bash: add to ~/.bashrc
eval "$(git pkgs completions bash)"

# Zsh: add to ~/.zshrc
eval "$(git pkgs completions zsh)"

# Or auto-install to standard completion directories
git pkgs completions install
```

### Aliases

Common commands have shorter alternatives:

- `ls` for `list`
- `rm` for `remove`
- `grep` for `search`
- `find` for `where`
- `audit` for `vulns`
- `praise` for `blame`

## Plugins

git-pkgs supports external plugins following the same convention as git and kubectl. Any executable on your `$PATH` named `git-pkgs-<name>` becomes available as `git pkgs <name>`.

```bash
# create a plugin
cat > ~/bin/git-pkgs-hierarchies <<'EOF'
#!/bin/sh
echo "custom plugin running with args: $@"
EOF
chmod +x ~/bin/git-pkgs-hierarchies

# use it
git pkgs hierarchies --some-flag
```

Plugins appear in a separate "Plugin commands" section in `git pkgs --help`. All arguments and flags are passed through to the plugin unmodified.

If a plugin name collides with a built-in command, the built-in takes precedence. When the same name exists in multiple `$PATH` directories, the first match wins.

## Configuration

git-pkgs respects [standard git configuration](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config).

**Colors** are enabled when writing to a terminal. Disable with `NO_COLOR=1`, `git config color.ui never`, or `git config color.pkgs never` for git-pkgs only.

**Pager** follows git's precedence: `GIT_PAGER` env, `core.pager` config, `PAGER` env, then `less -FRSX`. Use `--no-pager` flag or `git config core.pager cat` to disable.

**Submodules** are ignored by default when scanning the working directory to prevent reporting their dependencies as part of the main repository. Use `--include-submodules` to scan submodules:

```bash
git pkgs diff --include-submodules       # include submodule dependencies
git pkgs where lodash --include-submodules
```

**Ecosystem filtering** lets you limit which package ecosystems are tracked:

```bash
git config --add pkgs.ecosystems rubygems
git config --add pkgs.ecosystems npm
git pkgs info --ecosystems  # show enabled/disabled ecosystems
```

**Ignored paths** let you skip directories or files from analysis:

```bash
git config --add pkgs.ignoredDirs third_party
git config --add pkgs.ignoredFiles test/fixtures/package.json
```

**Direct registry mode** skips the ecosyste.ms API and queries package registries directly. Useful for private registries or airgapped environments:

```bash
git config pkgs.direct true        # enable globally
git config --local pkgs.direct true  # enable for this repo only
GIT_PKGS_DIRECT=1 git pkgs outdated  # one-off via environment
```

By default, git-pkgs uses a hybrid approach: packages with a `repository_url` qualifier in their PURL (indicating a private registry) are queried directly, while public packages go through ecosyste.ms for efficiency.

**Private registries and proxies:** For commands that query registries (`outdated`, `licenses`, SBOM enrichment), git-pkgs extracts registry URLs from lockfiles when available:

- npm: `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lock` (from `resolved` URLs)
- pypi: `Pipfile.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock` (from source configuration)
- cargo: `Cargo.lock` (from `source` field)
- composer: `composer.lock` (from `dist.url`)
- gem: `Gemfile.lock` (from `remote:` sections)

If your lockfile points to a private registry (like Artifactory or GitHub Packages), those URLs are used automatically. However, git-pkgs doesn't currently read config files like `.npmrc` or `.pypirc` for registry URLs or credentials. Authenticated private registries aren't supported yet for registry queries.

Commands that run package managers (`install`, `add`, `remove`, `update`) delegate to the actual CLI tools, which respect their native configuration. See the [managers documentation](https://github.com/git-pkgs/managers#configuration-files) for details.

**Environment variables:**

- `GIT_DIR` - git directory location (standard git variable)
- `GIT_PKGS_DB` - database path (default: `.git/pkgs.sqlite3`)
- `GIT_PKGS_DIRECT` - set to `1` to query registries directly (skip ecosyste.ms)
- `GIT_PKGS_ECOSYSTEMS_FROM` - email address sent as the `From` header on ecosyste.ms requests, putting you in the [polite pool](https://ecosyste.ms/api-policy) instead of the shared anonymous pool
- `GIT_PKGS_ECOSYSTEMS_API_KEY` - ecosyste.ms API key sent as a bearer token
- `GIT_PKGS_ECOSYSTEMS_BATCH_SIZE` - per-request batch size for ecosyste.ms bulk lookups

**Author mapping** via `.mailmap` is supported. If your repository has a [`.mailmap` file](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitmailmap), author identities are resolved to their canonical names when indexing commits. This helps deduplicate contributors in `blame`, `history`, and `stats` output.

## Supported ecosystems

git-pkgs uses [github.com/git-pkgs/manifests](https://github.com/git-pkgs/manifests) for parsing, supporting:

Actions, Bazel, Cargo, CocoaPods, Composer, Go, Hex, Maven, npm, NuGet, Pub, PyPI, RubyGems, and more.
